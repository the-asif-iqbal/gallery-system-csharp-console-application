Computerised Art Gallery System designed on C# Console Application
The Computerized Gallery System is a proposed computerized system for keeping track of the works of art shown and stored in a local private art gallery. It includes facilities for keeping track of each work of art from the time it enters the system. It runs on a single computer.
The system deals only with pieces submitted by artists, not pieces on loan from other art institutions. Information about the piece stored is limited to the artist who created the work. Curator information is also stored.

Processes:
The system offer the user the ability to:
1. add curators
2. update information kept on each curator
3. add artists
4. receive a piece into the collection
5. sell a piece, remove it from display, and update the curatorâ€™s commission
6. list artists, curators, and art pieces
